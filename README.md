# AI Literacy Resource Pack

This repository contains source documents and working files for an AI literacy initiative focused on higher education faculty, students, and community audiences.

## Structure

- `/pdf`  
  Original source documents (reports, guides, infographics, and articles) in PDF or image format.

- `/md`  
  Markdown conversions of key PDFs for reuse in slides, handouts, LMS content, and web pages.

## How to Use

- Start from `/md` when drafting:
  - slide decks,
  - workshop materials,
  - syllabus language,
  - student- or faculty-facing guides.
- Use `/pdf` for:
  - citation and verification,
  - layout inspiration (figures, tables, infographics),
  - checking any ambiguous or lossy Markdown conversions.

## Conventions

- Filenames in `/md` mirror the corresponding files in `/pdf` (e.g., `AILiteracy2024.pdf` → `AILiteracy2024.md`).
- Markdown files use:
  - `#` for document titles,
  - `##` / `###` for sections,
  - standard lists and tables (no HTML where avoidable).
- When editing Markdown, do not paste full copyrighted passages from the PDFs.
- Prefer summaries, paraphrases, and short quoted phrases with proper attribution.
- If you add new PDFs, keep names descriptive and sync the same name in `/md` when you create a Markdown version.
