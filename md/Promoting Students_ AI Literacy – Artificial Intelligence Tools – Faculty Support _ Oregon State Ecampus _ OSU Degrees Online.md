## **Promoting students’ AI literacy**

### **Why AI literacy?**


Students will need to develop a skill set for using and interacting productively and ethically with AI tools, for
personal, school-related, and work-related reasons. Some technical disciplines may decide to strategically
integrate these skills into their curricula to help prepare students for [rapidly changing workforce needs. In](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/09/top-skills-you-will-need-for-an-ai-powered-future-according-to-microsoft-.html)
other disciplines, teaching students how to use AI may not be explicitly necessary as part of the established
program or course learning outcomes, for example; but faculty may wish to help students develop their skill
set in a way that prepares them to be informed students, engaged citizens, and effective members of their
chosen profession. Incorporating AI literacy into diverse courses may be expedient in much the same way
that many faculty have integrated [critical thinking and digital literacy skills](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1143316.pdf) previously. (Faculty or
disciplinary groups may decide that encouraging AI use leads to a loss of learning – a perspective we are not
focusing on here.)

## **AI literacy frameworks**


AI researchers and scholars have already posited frameworks for teaching this skill set, which [Laupichler, et.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X2200056X#bib34)
[al (2023) point out is often termed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X2200056X#bib34) **AI literacy** . They describe AI literacy as: “the ability to understand, use,
monitor, and critically reflect on AI applications without necessarily being able to develop AI models
themselves.” Conceptualized in this way, AI literacy is a broad set of skills that is not confined to technical
disciplines. Laupichler, et. al., also provide a helpful overview and comparison of recent studies and
frameworks related to AI literacy that we recommend as a starting point for any faculty wishing to know
more about teaching AI skill development.


Of important note: the studies and frameworks included in that literature review predate the release of
ChatGPT in November 2022. We anticipate that these frameworks will be revisited and revised to account for
the now widely-available generative AI tools, as well as in light of the rapid and ongoing advancements in
these tools. However, the frameworks provide a useful point of departure for those thinking about how to
incorporate AI literacy into their courses.


[Take, for example, the four categories of skills that Ng, et. al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2021.100041) describe:


**AI literacy**
**Provided definition** **Potential current uses**
**skill set**



“Know & “Know the basic functions of AI
understand AI” and how to use AI applications.”



Integrating the history of AI tools; orienting students to
the basic elements and limitations of Large Language
Models (LLMs); identify relevant AI tools for student use
in courses and when/how to use them

**AI literacy**
**Provided definition** **Potential current uses**
**skill set**



Using AI as a tutor, as a reviewer of student-produced for
a course, etc.


Evaluate the bias and accuracy of AI-produced content;
create with tools that use AI technology or create AIbased tools.

Providing space to discuss course-specific and disciplinespecific intersections of ethical AI use; debating these
boundaries and applications, etc.



“Use & apply
AI”


“Evaluate &
create [with or
in] AI”



“Applying AI knowledge,
concepts, and applications in
different scenarios.”

“Higher-order thinking skills
(e.g., evaluate, appraise, predict,
design) with AI applications.”



“Human-centered considerations
“AI ethics” (e.g., fairness, accountability,
transparency, ethics, safety).”



These categories highlight different discrete skills that could be introduced and advanced in meaningful ways
within higher education courses.

## **Addressing AI literacy**


Faculty need not delve deeply into AI literacy development to help students navigate with these new
technologies. All courses would, in fact, benefit from even the lightest-touch approach to AI ethics where
[faculty explicitly address how AI can/can’t and should/shouldn’t be used in that particular course. Faculty](https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/faculty/artificial-intelligence-tools/practical-strategies/)
might also offer an open invitation to discuss further with the class how and why those guidelines have been
selected and what they mean in the context of activities and assignments in the course.


For faculty who may choose to allow the use of AI tools in the course, providing students structured guidance
and resources about how to use them could help to further equity in the course since some students may have
more familiarity with and access to AI tools than others. For example, in a course that includes an
individually-produced term paper, and where students are allowed to use AI tools to generate and evaluate
potential topics, faculty might provide an effective example of how to ask an AI tool to help, ideally situating
explanation in the context of what would be appropriate and ethical in that discipline or profession.
