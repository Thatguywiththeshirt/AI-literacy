# **Integrating AI into Assignments Workshop Kit**


Main content start


This workshop kit will help your audience develop student assignments that leverage AI and to leverage AI
to assist with grading.

## **Workshop goal and objectives**


This workshop can help participants integrate AI into student assignments and their grading process. The
workshop provides examples of instructors and courses that use AI, pedagogic principles to inform decisions,
and frameworks to guide the development of an AI-enhanced assignment.


After completing this workshop, participants should be able to:


       - Describe strategies and methods for designing effective learning activities.

      - Describe applicable AI tools and examples of how instructors and students can use AI chatbots for
assignments.

       - Describe issues related to using AI for grading and strategies that address them.

## **Audience**


This workshop is intended for instructors using AI tools for student assignments and using AI to aid them in
grading.

## **Time**


This workshop is approximately 70 minutes in length.

## **Key strategies**


This workshop identifies foundational pedagogic principles for designing assignments and grading student
work. Then it has participants apply them to generative AI tools. The workshop leverages active learning
strategies and culminates in a worksheet activity where participants will develop a concept for an AIenhanced assignment.


Consider the following strategies and perspectives when developing this workshop.


       - Encourage participants to recall their knowledge about effective teaching and apply it to AI contexts.

       - Encourage participants to view AI as a way to enhance existing positive practices rather than a way to
replace work.

       - Acknowledge that access to AI tools varies by institution, is likely evolving quickly, and is often
beyond the control of individual instructors. Encourage participants to focus on the pedagogical aspects
of the course that they can control.
