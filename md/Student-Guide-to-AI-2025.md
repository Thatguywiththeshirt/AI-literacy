### **Working with artificial intelligence**

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools use machine learning technologies
to analyze prompts, data and images and generate output, including written text,
voices, pictures, videos and more. These tools can mimic humans’ ability to learn,
reason, solve problems and make decisions.


**Never forget: AI is not human.** Despite brilliant algorithms that can simulate
a human personality, AI is not your companion and does not have emotions or
feelings. Use these technology tools to augment your human capabilities, not
replace them.

**Where and how can I use AI?**
**(Guess what: It’s already almost everywhere)**

AI powers the platforms we use every day, such as: Web
search engines, Netflix, Amazon, Maps, YouTube, Spotify,
Siri, Alexa, Instagram, TikTok, Uber and much more.


Your school may have licenses to provide AI accounts for
students. You can also use free versions provided by many
major platforms. If you need more powerful or specialized
tools, test different models before you subscribe.


Many computer programs now have embedded AI
capabilities. Microsoft includes Copilot in programs
like Word, Excel and Powerpoint. Google Docs include
embedded Gemini tools. Adobe and Zoom include AI

Many technology firms are now creating **AI agents** that
can take in information, generate plans and complete
tasks, such as drafting reports, scheduling meetings or

### **Academic integrity in the age of AI**

**“Cheating”** **and AI**

AI has complicated the concept
of academic integrity. Some
rationalize that “everybody uses
AI,” or “AI is just like any other
technology tool.”


Be faithful to this principle:
**the work you turn in must be**
**authentically yours** . Copying
AI-produced content verbatim
and representing it as your own
without attribution is cheating.


Cheating with AI deprives you
of the opportunity to develop
your own skills and intellectual
confidence. Your personal
development requires you to do
the hard work of learning.



**The bright “red line”**


If your professor says no use of
AI in their class, or on individual
assignments, **follow the rules** .
Remember that the rules may vary
on certain assignments. In some
cases, you may even be required
to use AI. To avoid crossing the
cheating “red line,” ask for specific
instructions on the use of AI on
each assignment.



**When the “red line” can be a bit fuzzy**



attribution to the ways AI contributed to the work.



Some assignments will permit or even require the use of AI. In these cases, keep these basic
principles in mind:




**•** When AI is allowed, use it to get oriented to a topic and gather information. Then, after

doing your own research and producing a rough draft on your own, share it with the AI
systems and ask for feedback and ideas about what you are missing or what could be
revised. This will allow **you** to remain the main author of the project, with AI providing
feedback.

**•** No matter how you use AI, the key is to **be honest and transparent**, giving clear

capabilities become increasingly valuable. Use AI
as a tool to supplement and amplify your essential
human abilities.

### **Create a two-part career plan** **for the age of AI**



No previous generation has encountered the
challenges you face in preparing for a career. You
must become proficient with AI while also developing
your distinctly human capabilities. Dedicate your
university years to gaining experience in both
domains, mastering this twin set of superpowers.



checking AI output, combining outputs from multiple AI tools,
writing and editing with AI, working ethically with AI
