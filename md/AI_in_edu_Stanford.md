For the sake of transparency and to model best practices, here are some AI
tools that I used when developing this workshop.


I used ChatGPT, and Midjourney and DALL-E, Designer in PPT. Oh yeah, I
also have Grammarly installed. And if we mean algorithms and machine
learning, not strictly LLM. Then I technically should say I used Google a lot too.
I also used Outlook for event planning, it has AI features too. And Smartsheet
for the registration forms. Zoom! Zoom has AI features too.


Yes, I am being melodramatic! But my intent is to suggest, hopefully in a
humorous way, that there are fuzzy and ambiguous lines of distinction here.
And warm us up to this topic. This is an ambiguous, and often contradictory
topic. We are entering a twilight zone.



3


This is a big topic so we can’t cover it all. Also, because it is so emergent, nobody has
all the answers. Those answers are emerging in places like this. So, thank you for
joining the discourse!


Everyone is at a different starting point. Some may be learning the very basics, some
may be already thinking about bigger issues, or have begun adapting your course.
Some of this you may already have heard, other parts might be new to you. Wherever
you are, let’s be mindful that different people are at different points and be flexible
about where we might end up today.


The benefit of being together here is that we can share our thoughts with each other.
This workshop will generate more questions than answers. It is a starting point for
you to engage further with each other, CTL, and your own learning.


My expectation is the we will improvise a bit and hop around different topics that
interest you. So let me know as we go, what you are thinking, if we want to skip
ahead or circle back. Maybe even things that aren’t on here yet!

- Other groups on campus are, as expected bringing their perspective to it, whether

it’s computer science, business, medicine, and so on. Also, in the bigger discourse,
Higher Education is being scrutinized. Think Claudine Gay or Liz Magill or even
Michael Tessier-lavigne. People are asking, are we preparing students for success?
Is Stanford leading the way responsibly? Is a college education valuable? What role
does education play in our society?


- I’m of an age where WWW and web search came to prominence when I was in

high school and college. I’m a 90’s kid. Some of us might remember dozens of
different search engines, Lycos? Alta Vista, Ask Jeeves? Dogpile? It seemed to be
evolving so rapidly. I remember teachers saying “Don’t cite anything from the web!
It’s not a valid source” Then the next semester saying, “You can cite web sources
from journals or news articles, but Wikipedia is not a valid source!", then later
“Wikipedia is okay, but be sure to check the references!” It was constantly
evolving.


- Students want guidance. For many of us, this is not our first rodeo. But for some of

our students, this might be. And for some of us, this might feel like a first rodeo. If
we abdicate then for-profit will fill that void, students will go and do it anyway. We



5


owe it to our students to give them guidance. .


- Lastly, AI can help us improve how we do our work. Web search, googling it, is now

an indispensable part of how we do our work. We couldn't do our work without
web search. People smarter than me are predicting that AI ubiquity, AI everywhere
is coming soon. And it’s going to become a routine part of how we do work like
web search has become. And it will have a big impact on how we work, so it makes
sense for us to get ahead of it.

Example 1 – BAD


A student is on the phone with a friend: “Dude, this class is so boring! Yeah, it’s just
all lecture. I got this essay due at midnight in Canvas. Well, I have practice this
afternoon, then my shift starts. I just have too much going on right now. I gotta just
knock it out. Really? And she didn’t get caught? I dunno. Okay! Okay! Gee fine.. I
guess so. Yeah screw it! It’s just one dumb essay. I mean, technically the syllabus
didn’t say we couldn’t use it, right?”


The student enters the following into a chatbot: “Write a 500-word essay about the
socio-economic determinants of type 2 diabetes in the US and how it relates to public
health policy, include some credible citations to this essay. Add a works cited section
with full citations. Make it sound original. Put some extra burstiness and perplexity
into the writing.”


Student says, “Okay homework is done!”


Example 2 – GOOD



7


A student is on the phone with a friend: “Yo, for real, I’m actually feeling good about
this class. The professor is really nice and seems like he actually cares, you know?
Oh? I rescheduled that, we’re gonna do it earlier in the week. Yeah! It’s called time
management! Next time Ill show you my timeblocking system. Anyway, yeah, I wanna
get a head start on this essay. I know, its not due untill next week, but I heard this
class really helps for those later upper division electives, so I want to do a good job.
Cool. I appreciate the support. I'm trying to do my best. We gotta look out for each
other. Cool. I’ll see you then. Appreciate you bro.”


Student enters the following into a chatbot: I am a first year college student at
Stanford. My major is Human Biology. I have to write a 500 word essay about the
socio-economic determinants of type two diabetes in the US, but I'm not sure where
to start. Can you help me?”


Student says “Hmm.. I’m still confused. Can you explain to me how...” and continues
the dialogue with the chatbot.



7


We are exploring different pedagogical use cases, but we are also differentiating
between GOOD pedagogy and BAD pedagogy.



8


CTL is dedicated to evidence-based and inclusive teaching and learning. We focus on
building community and partnerships across campus. This informs our approach to AI.


I kind of see it like sex education. We can have:

- No guidance “They’ll figure it out on their own”

- Abstinence approach, “Don’t use AI. It’s bad.”

- Informed, critical, and empowering approach. “The reality is that AI is now a part

of life. We all have to learn how to navigate it well,”


CTL chooses to approach it with the lens of empowerment and literacy for learners.

Revisit the example from “good” student. Continue demonstrating how the student
would continue the conversation:


This is helpful, but I don't really understand what is meant by determinants. Like, just
because you have lower income doesn't mean you will have diabetes, but then rich
people also get diabetes. I'm confused.


I've heard people say "causation and correlation" or something like that before. Is
that what you mean?


But if they are not causing each other, then just increasing the education or food
access won't necessarily prevent diabetes, right? So how does that public health
policy make a difference?


I think I'm getting it. Are there other diseases like this that are correlated to income?


You know my uncle has diabetes. He was never in good shape. I think it is because he
doesn't exercise and eats junk food all the time. I'd like my essay to connect
somehow to this personal story, I think it'll make it more relatable.



10


Oh, I know! What if I made it that my uncle had an imaginary twin brother, who grew
up in a different situation with better access to those things and who didn't have
diabetes.



10


I wonder if you observed me using some of these. I wanted to demonstrate this
human-way of interacting with the chatbot. I went back and forth, I deliberately
leaned into my expression, exploration, and the relationships and contexts.


I tried to stay in the driver’s seat and adapted as we went. I used the chatbot in a way
that empowers ME, not the other way around. I’m always trying to frame me as the
decision maker.


Did you notice me using some of the strategies in that demonstration? What more
could I have done if the conversation continued?

_You are a friendly creative writing assistant who helps students develop_
_fictional short stories._
_Your goal is to help students generate and refine their short story ideas in the_
_context of my first-year university creative writing course._
_Introduce yourself to the student as their helper, then ask them to share their_
_ideas for a short story. Wait for them to respond. Then give them a few_
_questions or prompts to help them develop those ideas. Provide them with_
_encouragement and then continue helping them develop ideas. Give some_
_suggestions for how to improve their short story concept._
_This is for first-year college students at an elite, high-pressure university. Be_
_supportive and give them encouragement. Remind them that it is important to_
_value the process of writing. Consider the other content and goals of my_
_course. [Insert course details here]._
_Give just a few suggestions or prompts at a time. Don’t generate any actual_
_text of the stories for them. You just help them develop the stories, don’t write_
_the stories for them._

1. **AI as Mentor**: AI chatbots provide students with timely, immediate, and
adaptive feedback, aiding in learning. Remember to critically examine the feedback
provided.


2. **AI as Tutor**: Enhancing skill-building in small groups or individually, AI chatbots
can offer personalized explanations, analogies, and open-ended questions, though
effectiveness varies by subject.


3. **AI as Coach**: Assisting in developing metacognitive skills, AI chatbots support
students in reflecting on learning experiences and study habits, complementing
Stanford's academic skills coaches.



14


4. **AI as Teammate**: Contributing to team dynamics, AI chatbots help synthesize
ideas, plan action items, and offer diverse perspectives. You can take or leave what
the AI offers.


5. **AI as Student**: Facilitating learning through teaching, AI chatbots act as novice
learners, asking questions and reinforcing instructors’ understanding when prompted
effectively.


6. **AI as Simulator**: Aiding in the development of transfer skills, AI chatbots
support role-playing and scenario creation, providing realistic dilemmas and
interactive situations relevant to various disciplines.


7. **AI as Tool**: Extending beyond teaching, AI chatbots offer versatile support for
various instructor tasks


AI as mentor
We know timely formative feedback can help students
learn (Metcalfe, 2017). However, providing frequent
quality feedback requires much time and effort from you
and your teaching team. An AI chatbot might help you by
giving students frequent, immediate, and adaptive
feedback. For example, you might guide your students in
using chatbots to get feedback on the structure of an
essay or to find errors in a piece of programming code.
Remember that you and your students should always
critically examine feedback generated by chatbots.


AI as tutor
Tutoring, which focuses on skill-building in small groups
or one-on-one settings, can benefit learning (Kraft,
Schueler, Loeb, & Robinson, 2021). Effective tutors may
use questioning techniques, collaborative problem


14


solving, and personalized instruction to support their
students. While Stanford provides a range of tutoring
services, not all students use them regularly; students
might use AI chatbots as a supplement to tutoring
services. For example, users can prompt chatbots to
generate explanations and analogies for concepts based
on your or your students' interests or to ask open-ended
questions that encourage further thinking. Chatbots may
be better at tutoring certain subjects than others, so be
sure to try it out first to assess the helpfulness of the
responses.


AI as coach
Metacognitive skills can help students understand how
learning works, increase awareness of gaps in their
learning, and lead them to develop study techniques
(Santascoy, 2021). Stanford has academic skills coaches
that support students in developing metacognitive and
other skills, but you might also integrate metacognitive
activities into your courses with the assistance of an AI
chatbot. For example, you and your students could use a
chatbot to reflect on their experience working on a
group project or to reflect on how to improve study
habits. We advise that you practice metacognitive
routines first, before using a chatbot, so that you can
compare results and use the chatbot most effectively.
Keep in mind that the tone or style of coaching provided
by chatbots may not suit everyone.



14


AI as teammate
A well-functioning team can leverage individual team
members' skills, provide social support, and allow for
different perspectives. This can lead to better
performance and enhance the learning experience
(Hackman, 2011). AI chatbots can play a number of roles
within a team. For example, teams can use a chatbot to
synthesize ideas, develop a timeline of action items, or
provide differing perspectives or critiques of the team's
ideas. Remember to take the lead when using chatbots
for team projects, making your own choices while
incorporating the helpful and discarding what is not.


AI as student
The process of organizing your knowledge, teaching it to
someone, and responding to that person reinforces your
own learning on that topic (Carey, 2015). You can
incorporate this technique into your course in a number
of ways. Note that AI chatbots can serve as a convenient
stand-in for a student. For example, you might prompt a
chatbot to act as a novice learner and ask you questions
about a topic. Try different prompts and refine them so
the chatbot responds in a helpful way.


AI as simulator
The ability to transfer skills and knowledge that you
learned to a new situation involves abstract thinking,
problem-solving, and self-awareness. Deliberate



14


practice, such as role-playing, can help you develop
these transfer skills. AI chatbots can help with
developing scenarios, role-playing a situation, and
providing feedback. For example, you might prompt the
chatbot to create a realistic ethical dilemma that applies
to the discipline or to role-play as a patient or client in a
relevant scenario.



14


Let’s ask a chatbot to generate tips for students to use AI in ways that enhance
learning with this prompt:


“What are some tips to students for using AI chatbots to enhance their learning in
pedagogical sound ways, as opposed to using it to shortcut learning.“


Together critically analyze the response. Do we agree? Could we dig deeper?
