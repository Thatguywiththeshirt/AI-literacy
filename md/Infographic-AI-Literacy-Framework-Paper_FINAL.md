#### _AI literacy is critical to safely_ _and effectively participate in_ _an increasingly digital world._

Our expanded AI Literacy Framework

depicts the relationship between AI

Literacy Practices, Core Values, Modes

of Engagement, and Types of Use that

support the knowledge and skills to

enable people to critically understand,

evaluate, and use AI systems and tools.

|AI Literacy Practices|Actionable practices of understand and evaluate<br>that learners can demonstrate|Data Privacy & Security, Information &<br>Mis/Disinformation|
|---|---|---|
|Core Values|Underlying principles that support learners to safely<br>and efectively use AI tools|<br>Human Judgment, Centering Justice|
|Modes of Engagement|Interconnected ways users can engage with<br>AI-enabled tools in order to demonstrate AI literacy|<br>Understand, Evaluate, Use|

## AI Literacy Practices

AI Literacy Practices are actionable skills that learners can demonstrate. These practices define how users

can Understand and Evaluate AI-enabled tools and how educators can support AI literacy development.

In the table below, we provide descriptions and examples of each of the AI Literacy Practices.


AI Literacy

Practice








|Algorithmic<br>Thinking,<br>Abstraction &<br>Decomposition|Develop and/or use a computer’s ability to<br>recognize data and create a prediction or<br>perform an action based on both the situation<br>and stored information without explicit<br>human guidance.|• Training and/or prompting AI tools and systems<br>• Defining procedures as algorithms<br>• Testing and debugging<br>• Breaking down problems into smaller parts|
|---|---|---|
|Data Analysis &<br>Inference|Consider the context of datasets, data<br>visualizations, and data collection with<br>criticality. Assess quality of training data for AI<br>tools and leverage AI models and methods to<br>collect, analyze, and visualize data.|•	Determine quality (accuracy, completeness, validity, etc.)<br>of dataset<br>•	Analyzing and organizing datasets<br>•	Describing patterns and relationships<br>•	Evaluating and deducing information|
|Data Privacy &<br>Security|Develop awareness of data privacy and<br>security while fostering ownership and<br>agency of how to protect data in AI-enabled<br>systems. This includes the privacy and<br>security of personal data collected by an AI<br>system or tool and how that data is used.|•	Identifying how personal information is being collected,<br>used, and shared<br>•	Preventing tools from collecting data and/or deleting data<br>that was collected<br>•	Identifying datasets that were used to train an AI model|
|Digital<br>Communication<br>& Expression|Understand how AI systems create synthetic<br>content, evaluate synthetic AI creations,<br>and consider ethical responsibilities when<br>consuming, creating, and sharing AI-enabled<br>products.|•	Understand norms and best practices of use, development,<br>and application of AI systems<br>•	Evaluate outputs of AI-enabled system for appropriate tone,<br>audience, and content<br>•	Responsibly engage in the consumption, creation, or sharing<br>of AI-enabled products, including ethical sourcing and<br>citation|
|Ethics<br>& Impact|Examine the outputs of algorithms and<br>question the biases inherent in the AI systems<br>and tools being used. Consider the benefts<br>and harms of AI tools to the environment,<br>people, or society. Importantly, consider how<br>datasets, reproduce bias in our society.|•	Understand how values, beliefs, and points of view are<br>applied through AI-enabled systems and outputs<br>•	Determine if and how an AI algorithm is the right tool for<br>the job<br>•	Consider the benefts and/or costs of AI to individuals,<br>society, and the environment<br>•	Understand if AI is perpetuating issues of access and equity|
|Information<br>& Mis/<br>Disinformation|Determine credibility of AI system outputs in<br>digital landscapes. This includes evaluating<br>datasets and AI products/outputs for false,<br>inaccurate, or misleading information.|•	Cite valid, reliable data and evidence that apply in a variety of<br>situations across contexts.<br>•	Evaluate the credibility or accuracy of an output or<br>prediction<br>•	Identify how bias in data collection informs reporting|
