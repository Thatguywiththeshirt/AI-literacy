# AI Literacy Markdown Library

This folder contains Markdown versions of the AI literacy source documents from `/pdf`, prepared for easy reuse in instructional design and content creation.

## Purpose

- Provide **editable, text-first** versions of key resources for:
  - slide decks and workshops,
  - LMS modules (Canvas, D2L, etc.),
  - policy templates and handouts,
  - web pages and internal docs.
- Reduce repeated copy‑paste from PDFs and minimize formatting clean‑up.

## Conventions

- Filenames mirror `/pdf`:
  - `AILiteracy2024.pdf` → `AILiteracy2024.md`
  - `AI_Across_Curriculum.pdf` → `AI_Across_Curriculum.md`
- Structure:
  - `#` document title
  - `##` major sections
  - `###` subsections
  - Use standard Markdown lists, code fences, and tables.

## How to Work With These Files

- Feel free to:
  - Reorganize sections for your use cases (e.g., faculty workshop vs. student guide).
  - Extract smaller chunks into separate modules or handouts.
  - Add your own headers, examples, or local policy language.
- Avoid:
  - Reconstructing full copyrighted layouts or long verbatim copies.
  - Losing original section headings that are important for tracing back to the source.

## Maintenance

- When you update a Markdown file based on a newer PDF version:
  - Keep the same filename where possible.
  - Add a brief change note at the top (e.g., `_Updated from 2024-06 version of the PDF._`).
- If a PDF exists in `/pdf` but not here, that’s a candidate for future conversion.
