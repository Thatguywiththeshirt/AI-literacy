##### You may have heard about the rise of “artificial intelligence,” or AI, technology that is having an enormous impact on business and society right now. But what is it, and what does it mean in practical terms for the lifestyle of older adults? **What is AI?**

The term “artificial intelligence” (AI) refers to systems that can “learn” by recognizing
patterns and can interact with humans using natural language.

##### **So the computer is smart like a human?**

Not exactly, despite decades of great science fiction that might make you think otherwise!
AI uses vast amounts of data from the internet and elsewhere to anticipate the most likely
response, so the responses can sound very well-informed and surprisingly human. But
people and computers solve problems in very different ways.

##### **How is AI changing the world?**

AI and its close cousin, “machine learning” (analyzing large data sets to find patterns and
make predictions), are making a lot of things better behind the scenes. For example, this is
the technology that:



Allows banks to quickly
spot patterns of fraud
to protect consumers,
and helps companies of
all kinds operate more
safely and efficiently.



Empowers scientists to
design and test new ideas
for solving healthcare,
energy, climate, and other
problems faster, leading
to the development of
important breakthroughs.



Promises to enable
futuristic things like
self-driving cars, robots,
and “smart cities.”




##### **Why is everyone talking about it now?**

A few years ago, AI took a leap forward with tools that can generate entire stories,
realistic photographs, and even creative artwork from a simple prompt (short command or
description). This is sometimes called “generative AI.” It refers to chatbots like ChatGPT,
workplace productivity tools like Microsoft Copilot, and apps for creating images like Dall-E,
which are all easy enough for anyone to use without being a computer expert.


##### **What’s hype and what’s real?**

AI has been advancing in leaps and bounds as companies invest billions of dollars. All that
development is creating unanticipated opportunities, unforeseen benefits, and a lot of
uncertainty. We’re at the beginning of a long journey.

##### **But what about the risks?**

Great question! For all the upsides of AI, it has some drawbacks that we need to understand.
It can be used for the kind of fraud and online scams that disproportionately victimize older
adults. It can allow bad actors to create realistic fake news stories and images (“deepfakes”),
or trick users into interacting with machines that seem very much like real people. It is
disrupting the workforce and forcing workers and businesses to adapt. Some are also
worried about the environmental impact of the data centers that power AI, consuming
enormous amounts of energy.

##### **Where can I find AI?**

AI is showing up in everyday consumer and workplace applications, such as:

- Thousands of companies and products are starting to incorporate AI features to make
things simpler for users by anticipating their needs and interests.

- Public websites like ChatGPT and Dall-E from OpenAI let anyone use powerful AI chatbots
and image generation tools, with free and pay-tier options.

- Browsers like Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome have AI assistants to make it easier to
search the web.

- Other popular software applications are starting to feature AI functions to simplify
common tasks like note taking, transcription, translation, and auto-generation of text
and images.




##### **But what does this mean specifically to older adults?**

Older adults have specific needs and circumstances. They steward money differently, have
different demands on the healthcare system, and are more vulnerable to certain kinds of
fraud, for example. We see the biggest areas of impact in three main areas:



**HEALTH**
Physical, mental, and
emotional well-being,
independence, longevity.



**WEALTH**
Personal finance
management, shopping
and saving, long-term
planning.



**SELF**
Learning and
self-development,
creativity, community.


##### AI can help older adults live healthier, more independent lives and better manage physical, mental, and emotional health issues. Here are some areas where AI is improving health outcomes: **Promote Fitness and Get Personalized Health Feedback**

You may have heard
about self-driving cars,
but what about a selfdriving wheelchair? AI
will be able to improve
safety, mobility, and
independence for
physically infirm
people of all ages.




##### AI can empower older adults to manage their finances with budgeting, money management, and money-saving tools. Here are some key ways AI can help: **Take More Control Over Your Money**

Many popular personal finance apps now include “robo-assistants” to provide insights
into spending, saving and investments. Like human investment advisors, these tools
are not flawless but can help you make more informed decisions and consider the
widest range of options.



**TODAY**
AI can offer personalized
investment advice,
including retirement
plans, based on your
unique financial goals,
risk tolerance, and current
financial situation. It can
help older adults make
informed investment
decisions and optimize
their portfolios.



**TODAY**
AI can track and
categorize expenses,
providing insights
into spending habits
and helping older
adults identify areas
where they can save
money.



**SOON**
For people who lack
resources or confidence
to do their own financial
planning, AI can deliver
personalized financial
literacy programs and
act as virtual financial
coaches, helping older
adults understand
complex financial
concepts and make more
informed decisions.


##### **Spend Less Time on Budgets and Record-Keeping**

Keeping track of personal finances can be time-consuming and frustrating. AI tools
are getting better at automating some of those tasks so seniors can focus on more
enjoyable activities.



**TODAY**
AI can automate bill
payments, ensuring that
payments are made on
time and helping older
adults avoid late fees and
penalties. These tools also
make it easier to set up
alerts and reminders for
important deadlines.



**SOON**
AI-driven budgeting
tools can analyze
spending patterns
and provide tailored
recommendations
for managing
expenses, saving
more effectively, and
planning for future
financial needs.



**SOON**
AI can help design
easy-to-use financial
apps that cater to
the needs of older
adults, with simplified
interfaces and clear
instructions.


##### **Shop Smarter and Save Money**

Everyone loves a bargain, but finding one online can take hours of price comparisons.
Imagine having a personal shopper to bring the best deals to you and even negotiate for the
best price.



**TODAY**
AI is built into popular
online shopping sites and
apps like Amazon, eBay,
Instacart, and Shopify,
helping consumers shop
online via voice interface,
and providing personalized
recommendations, as
well as feature and price
comparisons.



**TODAY**
AI chatbots like DoNotPay,
Trim, and Olark can help
seniors avoid frustrating
interactions with customer
service representatives,
from simple tasks like asking
for a refund or canceling
a subscription to more
complicated negotiations
that involve escalation to
responding to counteroffers.



**SOON**
AI agents are
available around
the clock. They can
automatically take
advantage of limitedtime offers so you
don’t miss out on
savings or exclusives,
even at inconvenient
hours.


##### **Stay Safer Against Fraud**

Online scams continue to prey on seniors. AI systems are working in the background to help your
financial institution spot irregular activity, and can help you protect yourself from bad actors.



**TODAY**
AI can help spot scam
emails and calls and either
block them before they
get through or alert you
to suspicious contacts.
Some email systems have
already implemented this
technology to disable fake
links to stop “phishing”
attacks.



**TODAY**
AI can learn your personal
spending habits and flag
unusual activity if your
personal data has been
compromised by an attacker.
Though these filters are not
perfect today, the more AI
learns about different kinds
of attacks, the smarter the
systems will get at taking
preventative actions.



**SOON**
Many of these
measures are
being implemented
automatically inside
of shopping apps,
payment platforms,
email systems, and
social networks,
reducing the risks
of online activity for
everyone.




##### AI can open new avenues of creativity and productivity by making it easy to create stories, images, and videos. AI is also helping seniors engage with friends, local communities, and important issues. **Keep Your Edge**

As you continue to contribute in your professional or post-retirement role, AI can amplify
your experience and expertise with tools that make common tasks easier.



**TODAY**
Professional applications like
Microsoft Office, Salesforce,
and SAP are incorporating AI
“copilots” into their products
to streamline the creation of

to individual needs.




##### **Unleash Your Creative Side**

AI can help you tell your stories, realize your artistic vision, and create music and videos
even if you don’t have the skills or training. While these tools are no substitute for human
creativity, they can still produce extraordinary results to give you a running start on any
creative project.



**TODAY**
Generative AI
art applications
like Dall-E and
Midjourney can
produce eyecatching artwork

folky singalong,
or Top 40-style
banger, based on a
description of the
style and mood.



**SOON**
AI video and
animation tools
promise to create
full-motion video
sequences based
on descriptions
or still images,
turning anyone
into a movie-maker
without the budget
or crew.


##### **Engage with Confidence**

Staying active and engaged in community events helps make life more rewarding, but some
seniors don’t know where to start making these kinds of social and personal connections.
AI can play a role in facilitating all manner of fun and impactful interactions.



**TODAY**
AI can help you find and
join communities of interest
online or in person. As the
AI gets to know you and
your tastes, it can find
current activities, groups,
or events that match
your past preferences.
If you are introverted or
lack confidence to join
new groups, an AI coach
like Replika can help you
recognize everything you
have to offer.



**TODAY**
If you’re looking for exercise

personalized matches
and improve user


##### AI is a revolutionary technology, but it can create problems if used in harmful or deceitful ways. Here are precautions and steps you can take to protect yourself. **Supercharged Online Fraud and Scams**

Bad actors are using AI to trick vulnerable individuals with realistic scams, including emails,
photos, and even voice and video clips that impersonate loved ones asking for money. Be
especially wary of unsolicited calls and communications unless you are sure of the source.
_What you can do:_ Ask the person something only you and they would know to verify
their identity. Don’t click on links, even in authentic-looking messages. Report suspicious
transactions immediately.

##### **Misleading and Deceptive Content**

Generative AI can produce very polished results, whether text, imagery, or video: so good
that the fakes can look very, very real. If you see news stories, photographs, or even audio
or video clips that don’t seem right to you, dig deeper before clicking or sharing. The bad
actors are counting on you passing misinformation along to give it more legitimacy.
_What you can do:_ Some online tools like Hive offer a simple way to check text and media
for the telltale signs of AI generation just by dragging and dropping a sample onto their
website.

##### **“Hallucinations” and Erroneous Responses**

Generative AI tools like chatbots and image generators sometimes produce bad
information or advice, due to a technical glitch that developers call “hallucination.” These
results can be unpredictable and range from the hilarious (calling toothpaste a good
pizza topping!) and bizarre (photographs with odd elements like extra fingers) to highly
convincing “facts” that happen not to be true.
_What you can do:_ Use caution when using AI for research and open-ended advice rather
than tackling straightforward, defined tasks.

##### **Copyright Caveats**

Because AI systems were built using data from the internet, there can be issues around the
ownership of the underlying materials and the output of the systems. Courts recently ruled
that content generated by AI systems is not subject to copyright protection. There are also
cases in the courts claiming that AIs have plagiarized copyrighted materials or used data
without permission.
_What you can do:_ Always be transparent about how and when you use generative AI in
work that you share to reduce problems that might arise.

##### **Trust, But Verify!**

At the end of the day, AI is meant to be a tool to amplify our humanity, not replace it. In
doing so, it sometimes replicates and amplifies our human foibles along with our strengths.
Just as we have done in earlier stages of the digital revolution, we need to use common
sense in our approach to dealing with AI content, especially as it comes into greater
mainstream use.
