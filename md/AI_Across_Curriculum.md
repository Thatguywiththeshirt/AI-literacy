Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a ubiquitous concept and tool already found across society and an integral part of
everyday life. As such, basic understanding and knowledge of AI should be a critical component of student
education to foster successful global citizens. This position paper describes one possible path to address potential
gaps in AI education and integrate AI across the curriculum at a traditional research university. The University of
Florida (UF) is infusing AI across the curriculum and developing opportunities for student engagement within
identified areas of AI literacy regardless of student discipline. The AI Across the Curriculum initiative being
developed at UF will make AI education a cornerstone opportunity for all students. The ultimate goal of AI Across
the Curriculum is the creation of an AI-ready workforce covering the essential 21st-century competencies
identified as workforce and government needs worldwide. Qualified human capital is essential to face the
challenges of the 21st-century, and UF is positioning itself to lead in meeting this global societal need. In
designing the AI Across the Curriculum model, all students are provided with a suite of AI opportunities and are
encouraged to engage. The university is taking advantage of a significant investment in AI campus-wide to
innovate curriculum and create activities that nurture interdisciplinary engagement while ensuring student
career readiness. As businesses, industry, and governments transform globally within this AI paradigm shift, AI
education, innovation, and literacy will become cornerstones of curriculum with UF providing an inclusive
example for all undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. While the AI effort at UF is inclusive and
broad, the focus of this paper is on undergraduate programs which also represents a Quality Enhancement Plan
(or QEP) effort for reaccreditation of UF’s undergraduate programs. This program is highly innovative and
transformative, creating interdisciplinary AI literacy opportunity for all students.



The 21st century has brought with it unprecedented changes in our
personal and professional lives. While advances in Artificial Intelligence
(AI), which can be broadly understood as computational systems and
toolsets which think and act rationally or in some cases like humans



(Russell & Noruig, 1995), continue to expand across diverse fields from
medicine to medieval literature, higher institutions are in a unique po­
sition to expand student competence in and awareness of AI. To stay
relevant, higher education must adapt to meet the needs of this rapidly
changing world. One area of particular importance is AI literacy
(Kandlhofer et al., 2016; Luckin et al., 2022; Ng et al., 2021). AI is no

longer just a concept from science fiction; it is increasingly becoming a
part of our everyday activities and is changing the way we interact with
the world around us (Cantú-Ortiz et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2020). As such,
it is crucial that future generations have an accurate understanding of AI
and its implications (Zimmerman, 2018). Despite AI expanding within
the world-at large, the diffusion of AI across the curriculum for both
undergraduates and graduates is sparse and inconsistent outside of the
traditional Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields
(Cantú-Ortiz et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2020; Ma & Siau, 2018). In addition,
recent educational researchers have argued that AI literacy is a mini­
mum learning outcome for all post-secondary and K12 students
(Kandlhofer et al., 2016; Luckin et al., 2022; Ng et al., 2021; Su et al.,
2022). Incorporating AI into the curriculum can help to achieve this goal
(Dai et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2021; Su et al., 2022). By providing all stu­
dents with AI learning opportunities, we can empower them with the
knowledge and skills needed to thrive in a world that is increasingly
shaped by AI. Additionally, AI literacy can help to prepare students for
jobs of the future (Kandlhofer et al., 2016; Long & Megerko, 2020; Ng
et al., 2021). As AI becomes more prevalent in the workplace, those who
understand and interface with AI will have a distinct advantage over
those with less developed AI skills. Integrating AI into higher education
is therefore essential for preparing students for the 21st-century work­
place (Cantú-Ortiz et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2021).
AI has been used for decades to assist with tasks such as voice
recognition, handwriting analysis, image recognition, and natural lan­
guage processing. AI is also becoming ubiquitous across society, from
self-driving cars to smart homes and voice assistants; AI is changing how
we interact with the world around us (Cantú-Ortiz et al., 2020; Hu et al.,
2019; Ng et al., 2021). This means that AI is not something that will
happen in the future but rather something that we are living through
today (Cantú-Ortiz et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2019;
Kandlhofer et al., 2016; Luckin et al., 2022). One study showed that only
33% of consumers surveyed claimed to have used AI for a specific task,
which is shockingly low given that already 77% of devices we use
feature some form of AI (PEGA, 2022). The most common of these tasks
were making purchases, searching for information, and conducting
research. The technological development of AI has had a significant
impact on our society in work, education, and other aspects of daily life.
Though there are many opinions about the implications of AI for society
now and in the future, one thing is certain: AI’s presence cannot be
ignored (Cantú-Ortiz et al., 2020; Kandlhofer et al., 2016; Ng et al.,
2021). Our society is more digitalized and automated than ever before.
We will have to understand what AI is, and how it works to succeed in
this new digital paradigm.
AI is defined in diverse ways, as there often is a discipline or industry
perspective or application for which a particular definition is derived.
For our purposes in this paper, AI refers broadly to include related
expertise and disciplines when used with AI (e.g., such as statistics and
data science). This broad definition is comprehensive of all AI applica­
tions and fits the interdisciplinary nature of our _AI Across the Curriculum_
model. Thoughtful incorporation of AI into a curriculum is one approach
for providing AI knowledge and skills to the next generation (Ng et al.,
2021). With a better understanding of what AI is and how it can be used,
we can provide students with knowledge and skills that are needed for
the 21st century (Buckingham Shum & Deakin Crick, 2016; Cantú-Ortiz
et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2020; Luckin et al., 2022; Markauskaite et al.,
2022; St Louis et al., 2021; Su et al., 2022). To meet this goal, higher
education needs to integrate theories and applications of AI across the
curriculum and disciplines and not consider it as an ‘add on’ require­
ment that becomes a check box instead of an essential element to the
curriculum. UF’s new model was designed to create a curriculum for
students to succeed in acquiring their AI knowledge and skills related to
identified AI literacy topics.
The next generation of students requires competency in AI literacy to
recast a new societal norm embracing AI and integrating it into daily
tasks. Additionally, students need competency to interpret AI for success



in their personal and professional lives (Kandlhofer et al., 2016; Ng
et al., 2021). Learning about AI can provide students with insight into
new career paths as well as potential mentors to further develop their
credentials and workforce readiness. Thus, the AI literacy model we
propose encourages interdisciplinary engagement further expanding
student experiences and career readiness skills (Zimmerman, 2018).
Although this paper focuses on the curriculum and academic scholarship
of higher education, the AI curriculum at UF, as well as other univer­
sities, does not exist independently from university research. Research
activities are often integrated with teaching activities and each benefits
from the other. The investment of universities in research to remain
innovative and relevant in the technological race contributes to the
quality of student learning and its ability to create translational career
skills. AI is already being used in many different disciplines, and there is
no question that it will be part of students’ lives. Thus, greater AI
competency in students will provide them with a greater potential for
achievement (Borenstein & Howard, 2021; Cantú-Ortiz et al., 2020;
Kandlhofer et al., 2016; Long & Megerko, 2020; Ng et al., 2021).


**2. Identifying the GAP - Why do we need AI education?**


The technological innovations of the 21st century have created a
world that fundamentally operates differently. These innovations have
also generated new expertise and workforce needs that did not previ­
ously exist (Buckingham Shum & Deakin Crick, 2016; Cantú-Ortiz et al.,
2020; Kandlhofer et al., 2016; St Louis et al., 2021). Some have referred
to this as the Fourth Industrial Revolution and have identified the impact
of these innovations on how we live and work (Ahmad, 2019; Ng et al.,
2021). For example, the World Economic Forum (2022) described the
Fourth Industrial Revolution as “merging the physical, digital, and
biological worlds and fusing technologies in ways that create both
promise and peril.” Additionally, the Forum highlighted the need to
integrate ethics when developing and using new innovations. This in­
cludes engaging public and private sectors to create recommendations
for policies that embrace ethical practices in innovation and thus in­
crease the benefits of AI innovations more broadly. The Forum also
identified AI as a cross-disciplinary concept and as an intricate and
developing component of our world in the 21st century (World Eco­
nomic Forum, 2022). Likewise, governments have recognized the AI
expertise needed to ensure future growth and stability. The 2021 Na­
tional Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) Final
Report noted that “big decisions need to be made now to accelerate AI
innovation to benefit the United States and to defend against the malign
uses of AI.” The report also identifies human talent in AI-enabled tech­
nology as the greatest barrier for the United States national security
sector. The report further outlines the need to develop a digitally literate
workforce with AI readiness by 2025 (NSCAI, 2021).
Not only has there been global and government recognition of AI as a
topic to be explored across disciplines, the National Academies of Sci­
ences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) published a report titled
“Data Science for Undergraduates: Opportunities and Options”. This
report outlined the importance for students of all backgrounds, disci­
plines, and professional goals to have the opportunity to learn data
science. They identify different elements of data science including “the
availability to understand data, making good judgements about and
good decisions with data, and using data analysis tools responsibly and
effectively” (NASEM, 2018, p. 138). Data science has an important role
with AI. The two topics are often used together given that data science is
the first step to creating or implementing AI methods, and the limita­
tions or biases present in data will appear in the AI created solution
(Borenstein & Howard, 2021; Long & Megerko, 2020). The acknowl­
edged need by the NASEM (2018, p. 138) for all students to have this
opportunity further emphasizes the necessity to educate and provide
experiences across disciplines instead of focusing on a narrow subset of
students having the opportunity to learn about data science. In a similar
fashion, universities and colleges have embraced the importance of

speaking and communication skills across all disciplines. Thus, prece­
dent exists where a topic or skill has been shown to have broad need and
therefore was integrated across college and university campus disci­
plines to benefit students and future employers (Cantú-Ortiz et al., 2020;
Kandlhofer et al., 2016; St Louis et al., 2021). For our purposes, we
consider AI to be inclusive of related data science.
Higher educational systems in the United States have evolved to
prepare students to enter the workforce as a primary mission. As such,
colleges and universities continually adapt the curriculum to align with
employer needs (Ahmad, 2019; Cantú-Ortiz et al., 2020; St Louis et al.,
2021). One need clearly identified globally, and also specifically in the
United States, is for individuals entering the workforce with greater AI
knowledge and skills to meet 21st-century challenges (Buckingham
Shum & Deakin Crick, 2016; Cantú-Ortiz et al., 2020; Kandlhofer et al.,
2016). The NSCAI Report (2021), along with the NASEM report (2018)
and the World Economic Forum (2022), all provide a consistent
mandate for modifying university curricula to meet the knowledge and
skills workforce needs.


**3. AI in higher education**


The infusion of AI across so many aspects of human life has created a
need for us to not only be able to use AI (even when we do not realize it)
but to also have a greater understanding of its broad applications, use­
fulness, limitations, and biases. Thus, there is a need for a concerted
effort to educate across all sectors to create a population better prepared
to thrive in our rapidly evolving AI-enabled world (Cantú-Ortiz et al.,
2020; Dai et al., 2020; Zimmerman, 2018). Even as some AI specialists
openly speculate that a fundamental understanding of AI is not neces­
sary (Lee, 2017), we believe it is critical to provide everyone with
fundamental knowledge related to AI and its diverse and ever-increasing
applications (Borenstein & Howard, 2021; Dai et al., 2020; Kandlhofer
et al., 2016; Long & Megerko, 2020; Ng et al., 2021). This includes
creating greater opportunities for scientists, engineers, medical pro­
fessionals, and everyone who deals with data and information to un­
derstand the basics of machine learning, deep learning, and the various
AI techniques that are impacting our lives. Note, we are not suggesting
that every student needs to have a Ph.D. in AI or machine learning. We
are, however, suggesting that there is a need for greater education across
the spectrum of societal needs (Ng et al., 2021). It is particularly the
responsibility of educators – who are generally reflective practitioners –
to understand the ramifications of implementing AI in the educational
system and to take active steps to prepare students for their roles as
stakeholders and citizens in a world defined by the interaction of tech­
nologies (Zimmerman, 2018).
To date, the incorporation of AI within the curriculum has been
restricted to certain STEM disciplines and fields, such as data science,
computer science, and engineering (Cantú-Ortiz et al., 2020; Kandlhofer
et al., 2016). While these are important disciplines and are clearly those
where programming and AI development expertise often reside, it has
also become apparent that there is a critical need for broader AI edu­
cation campus-wide (Ng et al., 2021). Looking at existing programs in AI
education, institutions of higher education currently have very limited
campus-wide AI initiatives. AI is not simply a set of tools that can be
considered in isolation, as technologies often are. AI, instead, is a
comprehensive set of skills or approaches for transdisciplinary inquiry,
and it encompasses, or should encompass, the full life experience and
education of a learner. AI should be built into the fundamental curric­
ulum goals of a university. Some programs have embraced this
cross-disciplinary idea such as University of California, San Diego, the
University of Washington, and the University of California, Berkeley.
However, a considerable lack of depth and breadth still exists when it
comes to AI education, which is a critical issue since AI is not simply a
computational discipline. Rather, AI is a pedagogical challenge as it
represents a broad array of fundamental skills and approaches, as well as
significant and important questions of ethics and bias, and as such,



should be an important part of any quality higher education curriculum
(Cantú-Ortiz et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2021).
To consider how _AI Across the Curriculum_ initiatives could be
developed, we can learn from K-12 curricula which have some experi­
ence incorporating the rapid expansion of technology, and specifically
AI, into education (Chiu & Chai, 2020; Kandlhofer et al., 2016; Xia et al.,
2022). This formal incorporation of AI into the K-12 curricula has been
occurring both nationally and internationally. United States entities
including Google for Education, Microsoft K-12 Education Trans­
formation Framework, the National Science Foundation, and a whole
suite of computer-based special interest and education groups have been
part of the development and call for technology integration in K-12
student curricula. This process is ongoing, and while they are currently
at the beginning stages of developing such programs, institutions of
higher education can certainly learn from these guidelines, curricula,
tools, and resources (Lee et al., 2021).
The movement to incorporate AI in education has arisen in various
countries in recent years (Cantú-Ortiz et al., 2020). For example, in
2017, China’s State Council announced its intention to include an AI
curriculum in primary and secondary education and set the goal of
becoming a world leader in AI by 2030. In 2018, AI was officially
introduced into the curriculum by the Education Ministry, and the first
AI textbook was utilized (Chiu & Chai, 2020; Dai et al., 2020; Su et al.,
2022). Singapore has developed AI education opportunities for both
teachers and students, with the creation of two AI programs: “AI for
Students” which looks at facilitating AI formal and informal learning for
secondary school students, and the “AI for Kids” (AI4K) program, which
trains both schoolteachers and parents to become AI Bootcamp in­
structors for primary students. At the same time, in 2018 the govern­
ment announced “AI Singapore” to develop students’ capabilities in AI
(Su et al., 2022). Likewise, programs in K-12 in Hong Kong, Japan, and
Korea were developed from 2017 to 2019, all aimed at incorporating AI
education into school curricula, although some of these are focused
more on technology skills and development, more than a holistic un­
derstanding of AI (Xia et al., 2022). In 2020, the European Union
developed a white paper on “Artificial Intelligence—a European
approach to excellence and trust” and now plans to incorporate AI at all
levels of education. However, even with all these national-level de­
velopments, there is still a lack of consistent approaches or even
agreement on AI curricula and content to be covered (Chiu & Chai,
2020; Dai et al., 2020; Kandlhofer et al., 2016; Ng et al., 2021; Su et al.,
2022; Xia et al., 2022).
There are currently a few university-level resources that represent a
more comprehensive approach to incorporating AI into the curriculum.
Stanford University launched a new institute for Human Centered
Artificial Intelligence (HAI, announced in 2019). Their institute includes
building partnerships with a wide range of entities with a goal of a better
future for humanity through AI and a specific focus on becoming an
[interdisciplinary global hub for AI (https://hai.stanford.edu/). Likewise,](https://hai.stanford.edu/)
Northwestern University focuses on curriculum availability for
educating university students and workforce professionals on AI theory,
[practice, and impact (https://ai.northwestern.edu/education/index.](https://ai.northwestern.edu/education/index.html)
[html). However, these programs are found only in their computer sci­](https://ai.northwestern.edu/education/index.html)
ence and electrical and computer engineering departments. Other uni­
versities such as Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and
Carnegie Mellon have created courses or programs that are centered
around the study of the ethics and implications of AI. All of these ini­
tiatives, whether at lower school (or elementary), upper school (middle
and high schools), or within select programs and higher education, lead
us to ask ‘What are the most effective and useful programs that infuse AI
concepts across a curriculum and within all disciplines within higher
education?’ From a simple review of the literature and the ubiquitous
nature of AI already within society, evidence shows we are at a critical
moment in which we must educate all students with basic concepts and
knowledge of AI. How then will institutions of higher education build AI
curricula ready to face the challenges of the 21st-century and ensure our

students graduate with the knowledge and skills to not only survive but
thrive in the 21st-century workplace? (Ahmad, 2019; Borenstein &
Howard, 2021; Cantú-Ortiz et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2020; Kandlhofer
et al., 2016; Long & Megerko, 2020; Ng et al., 2021; St Louis et al.,
2021). The lack of comparable case studies at other institutions in the
United States or more globally, highlights the relevancy and timeliness
of this academically inclusive model of AI Across the Curriculum. While
this program is currently in development and implementation at UF,
future evaluation and assessment of the model outcomes and goals will
be of critical importance. Laupichler et al. (2022) reported on 30 studies
(from 902 initial records) describing how AI literacy was being taught in
higher and adult education. They found the research to be in its infancy
and identified the need for refinement of concepts and materials. In
addition, none of these reviewed studies portrayed campus wide ini­
tiatives, again highlighting the novelty of this position paper presenta­
tion and current lack of comparable case-studies for this model of _AI_
_Across the Curriculum_ instituted at a major university of higher
education.
This then is the goal of UFs _AI Across the Curriculum_ initiative. The
University has already invested in AI development and engagement
across campus, built a world-class faculty well-versed in the concepts,
and assembled a technical staff of AI specialists to assist faculty and
students in using the latest AI supercomputer. The educators are
forward-thinking visionaries who are creating a curriculum for the 21stcentury. UF will enable students to be ready for that future and engage
with it. An investment has been made in the fundamentals that are
necessary to infuse AI across all disciplines and to build a curriculum
that will empower students to be at the forefront of the wave of
technology.


**4. AI across the curriculum at UF**


_4.1. UF investment in AI_


The University of Florida with support from NVIDIA recently
launched higher education’s eighth most powerful supercomputer and
the 22nd most powerful system in the world, which represents a com­
plete transformation for computational abilities and opportunities
campus wide (Merrit, 2021). The supercomputer, called HiPerGator, is a
room-sized supercomputer that draws 1.1 MW at full capacity. HiPer­
Gator is built with 291,024 cores using 148 NVIDIA DGX systems and
1120 NVIDIA A100 processors which are optimized for AI operations.
When processing, HiPerGator chews through calculations peaking at 21,
314.7 teraflops/second. It is this investment which spurred the initiative
to develop _AI Across the Curriculum_ at UF, and while researchers must
pay for its use on funded projects, the resource is freely available for
instructional and pedagogical purposes.
NVIDIA’s Cheryl Martin sees a future where AI-ready employees will
be crucial to the workforce; and thus, NVIDIA contributed UF’s super­
computer to support this outcome. She also recognizes opportunities for
rethinking jobs through technological change–creating new tools or
training people in skills needed by 21st-century industries, but which
currently have not been integrated into campus-wide curricula. With the
help of NVIDIA, students and faculty at UF can access a supercomputer
for research or teaching. This is an exciting development in education
because it not only provides access to powerful computer hardware but
also creates a skilled workforce trained on how to best use such
technology.
UF is unique given the breadth of disciplines and expertise available
at the state’s premier Land-Grant institution, with hundreds of faculty
members already using AI in their research and teaching programs. UF’s
faculty was recently expanded with the addition of over 100 newly
hired, AI-focused faculty to increase the university’s AI teaching and
research capacity and to prepare thousands of students annually to enter
society equipped for success. University Provost, Dr. Joseph Glover be­
lieves this to be a transformational initiative given the resource



investment and the many opportunities available through these tech­
nologies. Based on these investments in AI, the greater goal then be­
comes how to bring _AI Across the Curriculum_ to fruition in terms of
pedagogy, curricular design, and program development, so that all
interested UF students can engage in AI and to revolutionize our insti­
tution and our future.
This obvious need (as outlined previously from global, government,
and academy reports) for a shift in our programs to integrate crosscutting pedagogy focused on AI was noted by UF leadership in the UF
2020 and 2021 Accountability Plans (University of Florida 2020
Accountability Plan, ; University of Florida 2021 Accountability Plan, ).
The plans outline the need for a focus on AI to provide a growing future
economy for Florida, to allow the university to become a national leader
in AI, and to provide increased opportunities for our students. UF made
AI the centerpiece of a major, long-term initiative that combines
world-class research infrastructure, cutting-edge research, and a trans­
formational approach to curriculum. The University’s AI efforts were
further supported by investment from private and corporate philan­
thropy, the launch of a new supercomputer (previously described), and
over 100 new faculty hires across all 16 colleges (Fig. 1) with more
hiring still underway. The UF Provost also recognized the need for
centralized leadership of such a bold academic effort and established the
Artificial Intelligence Academic Initiative (AI [2] ) Center in 2022. This AI [2 ]

Center provides leadership and organization for the UF AI curriculum
and other AI-related academic activities across campus.


_4.2. AI pedagogy_


AI pedagogy refers to the methods and strategies used to teach
artificial intelligence (AI) to students. It encompasses not only technical
skills related to AI programming and algorithms, but also the broader
concepts and principles of AI, such as machine learning, natural lan­
guage processing, and robotics. One important aspect of AI pedagogy is
the emphasis on hands-on, experiential learning. This can include
working on projects that apply AI techniques to real-world problems,
participating in hackathons or coding competitions, and engaging with
open-source AI communities. These activities not only help students
learn technical skills, but also foster creativity, critical thinking, and
problem-solving skills that are essential for success in the field of AI.
AI literacy, on the other hand, which was first coined as a term in
2015 by KonishiY (2015), refers to the knowledge and understanding of
AI that is necessary for individuals to participate in the broader
discourse around AI and make informed decisions about its use and
implications (Laupichler et al., 2022). This includes an understanding of
the capabilities and limitations of AI, as well as its potential impact on
society and the ethical considerations involved in its development and
deployment. Developing AI literacy is important for a number of rea­
sons, most already discussed above. For one, AI is increasingly being
integrated into various aspects of our lives, from self-driving cars to
virtual assistants, and technology users should have the knowledge and
understanding to make informed decisions about the use of these in­
novations (Lee et al., 2021). In addition, as AI continues to advance, it
will likely have a significant impact on the job market and the nature of
work, and thus, our students benefit when graduating with the knowl­
edge and skills to adapt and thrive in this changing landscape (Lau­
pichler et al., 2022). In a review by Laupichler et al. (2022) the authors
note that research on AI literacy is still very young and as such there is
little literature available on this topic. Li (2021) discusses how defini­
tions of AI literacy are currently lacking. Again, this highlights the ne­
cessity for building a strong model of AI literacy within higher
education, that is potentially transformative of how we incorporate AI
pedagogy across the curriculum. It also serves to highlight the impor­
tance of future assessment and reporting on UF’s _AI Across the Curriculum_
initiative in terms of its successes and failures as a program focused on
addressing AI literacy needs campus wide.
The pedagogy of teaching at universities has developed to refine

knowledge and skills with focus on a topic or degree, such as engi­
neering, geography, medicine, or economics. While this method is useful
in many regards, limitations to this approach are evident; specifically,
this approach lacks engagement of students across interdisciplinary
teams more reflective of a workplace environment, lacks engagement of
students with industry partners, and lacks exposure of students to timesensitive, real-world challenges. The curriculum can be improved by
identifying a mechanism to link disciplines and address these limita­
tions. AI offers a timely and relevant mechanism to bridge this gap. Not
only does AI provide this unique opportunity for transformative peda­
gogy, but there is a global and national need for a workforce trained in
AI. The problems society faces are truly complex, and viable solutions
often depend on integration of domain expertise with powerful tools
such as those found in AI. However, our current education system often
does not recognize that these solutions require convergent thinking.
The AI [2 ] Center is the central organizational point at UF for AI-related
academic programs, and thus, it is also the entity that is responsible for
the implementation of the 2024 Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP), titled
_AI Across the Curriculum_, which is required by the Southern Association
of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) accredi­
tation every 10 years. The undergraduate-focused QEP requires key el­
ements, including topic identification through a comprehensive process,
broad base support from institutional constituencies, focus on improving
specific student learning outcomes and/or student success, the
commitment of resources from the institution, and assessment methods
which are evaluated through the duration of the program. This devel­
opment of the UF comprehensive plan began in 2021 with the estab­
lishment of a task force. The UF Provost Office charged two co-chairs
(authors Jane Southworth and Kati Migliaccio) and a diverse committee
from across the university community, with the task of developing a QEP
with a topic focus on _AI Across the Curriculum_ . Given the QEP necessity
for undergraduate program accreditation and the AI-related resources
available, an opportunity was presented to consider a QEP plan that not
only focused on a theme but also integrated pedagogical changes to
better serve our students and prepare them for the 21st-century pro­
fessional workforce. The new pedagogy model we propose was derived
from activities required for the QEP and the ongoing AI based initiative
across campus.



_4.3. UF AI literacy model_


In higher education, AI is currently used to enhance the learning
experience and improve student outcomes and is collectively referred to
as Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED). There are several ap­
proaches to using AI in higher education, including using AI to
personalize learning, facilitate communication, and enhance assessment
(Chen et al., 2020; Hwang et al., 2020). AI can be used to create
customized learning experiences based on the individual needs and
abilities of each student. This can be accomplished through adaptive
learning algorithms, which adjust the content and pace of the learning
material based on the student’s progress. Personalized learning can help
students stay engaged in the material, leading to better outcomes.
Another approach to using AI in higher education is to facilitate
communication. AI can be used to create virtual assistants or chatbots
that help students communicate with their instructors and classmates.
These assistants provide support and answer questions, freeing up in­
structors to focus on more complex tasks. AI can also be used to create
virtual reality environments where students practice skills and interact
with others in a simulated setting. Finally, AI can also be used to
enhance assessment in higher education. AI algorithms can be used to
grade essays and other written assignments, freeing up instructors to
focus on providing feedback and helping students improve. Likewise, AI
can assist in creating adaptive tests that adjust the difficulty of the
questions based on the student’s progress, allowing for more accurate
assessment of their knowledge. More recently, the metaverse concept
(think of a fully or partially virtual world where social activities such as
discussions, collaborations, games etc. can occur) has been introduced to
expand the use of AIED and it is expected that more research and case
studies related to such metaverse-based education will be reported in the
future (Hwang & Chien, 2022). Overall, AI has the potential to signifi­
cantly improve the learning experience in higher education. By
personalizing learning, facilitating communication, and enhancing
assessment, AI can help students learn more effectively and achieve
better outcomes. While AIED has been established as a field for over 30
years, this paper deals with a different emphasis of AI in Education – that
of training students and our future workforce in AI pedagogy such that
graduating students are AI literate.
AI literacy is the ability to understand, use, evaluate, and ethically
navigate AI (Long & Megerko, 2020; Laupichler et al., 2022). There are

four key areas of AI literacy. 1) Knowing and understanding AI involves
understanding the basics of what AI is and how it works. This includes
knowledge of machine learning algorithms, the data that is used to train
them, and the limitations and biases that can be present in AI systems. 2)
Using and applying AI involves the ability to use AI tools and platforms
to solve problems and accomplish tasks. This may involve coding and
programming skills, as well as the ability to understand and work with
large datasets. 3) Evaluating and creating AI involves the ability to
assess the quality and reliability of AI systems, as well as the ability to
design and build AI systems that are ethical and fair. This requires a deep
understanding of the technical aspects of AI as well as an understanding
of the social and ethical implications of AI. 4) AI ethics involves un­
derstanding the moral and ethical implications of AI and being able to
make informed decisions about the use of AI in various contexts. This
includes considerations of fairness, transparency, accountability, and
the potential impacts of AI on society and individuals. Overall, being
literate in AI requires a combination of technical knowledge and un­
derstanding of the social and ethical implications of AI (Yi, 2021). In­
dividuals and society as a whole benefit from being aware of the
capabilities and limitations of AI which allows for responsible and
ethical use (Borenstein & Howard, 2021; Dai et al., 2020; Kandlhofer
et al., 2016; Long & Megerko, 2020; Ng et al., 2021; Zimmerman, 2018).
The foundation of the UF model is based on these four AI literacies as
outlined in the previous paragraph and discussed in more detail by Ng
et al. (2021). A fifth category, “Enabling AI”, was also identified to
capture academic courses that support AI through related knowledge
and skill development (e.g., programming, statistics) and/or contain a
lower total AI content of one of the four Core AI literacy topics. Each of



these categories contains a variety of knowledge and skills that students
can learn through different types of experiences (Fig. 2). For example,
students might learn about AI through reading texts, watching videos, or
attending lectures. Alternatively, students might learn about AI through
hands-on experiences, such as coding projects or data analysis. The UF
model is designed to first clarify the different AI literacies presented in
different academic activities (Dai et al., 2020; Kandlhofer et al., 2016;
Long & Megerko, 2020; Ng et al., 2021). This allows students to build
their expertise by selecting courses focused on literacies of their interest.
Second, the UF model provides students with identified AI literacies by
course that can be packaged to showcase student AI skills and 21st
century competencies (Buckingham Shum & Deakin Crick, 2016; Can­
tú-Ortiz et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2021). Lastly, the course AI identification
approach allows review of course offerings to identify gaps or needs to
ensure AI learning opportunities are available for all undergraduate
students.
To focus the plan on student learning and the conditions that
enhance student learning, these five AI categories were identified to be
developed and assessed (Long & Megerko, 2020). These concepts were
validated in the literature (Ng et al., 2021) and matched to the goals of
the _AI Across the Curriculum_ QEP (Fig. 2). The QEP task force identified a
need to develop a process to evaluate courses faculty considered as ‘AI’
in a consistent manner and to designate each as a particular AI category.
This process would help students determine which AI literacy compe­
tencies they would gain from each course, allow the AI [2 ] Center to ensure
classes identified as AI met the expected criteria, and assist with tracking
the competencies taught. The course AI identification process is
managed via an AI curriculum subcommittee, within the process of

existing undergraduate and graduate curriculum committee review at
UF, similar to how General Education courses are reviewed. UF’s AI
curriculum subcommittee reviews, evaluates, and identifies the AI
knowledge and skills within the course. This course identification began
by reviewing almost 230 existing AI related courses, and then evaluating
new courses as they are submitted to the university curriculum
committee.
To focus the plan on student learning and the conditions that
enhance student learning, the Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs) for
each of the five AI literacy types are identified. The State of Florida
Board of Governors has mandated that all baccalaureate degree pro­
grams in the state public universities develop Academic Learning
Compacts (ALCs) that include SLOs in three areas: content knowledge,
critical thinking, and communication. SLOs were developed to align
with these goals and be measurable (Fig. 2, Table 1).
The UF AI Literacy Model is integrated into the different AI initia­
tives as a foundational component across the curriculum. This founda­
tional model can be seen in the four initiatives identified for
implementing the _AI Across the Curriculum_ QEP including 1) curriculum
development, 2) academic programs and pathways, 3) AI undergraduate
scholars and AI undergraduate medallion programs, and 4) AI career
development and industry engagement. While these initiatives were
designed for the undergraduate-focused QEP, their implementation is
relevant across all of campus. Specific initiatives are outlined below with
key elements.


_4.3.1. Curriculum development_
The QEP curriculum development initiative includes both creating
new AI course content and identifying AI literacy categories present in
both existing and newly developed academic courses. Both activities are
managed by the AI [2 ] Center. The AI [2 ] Center leads the new Undergraduate
Curriculum Committee (UCC) subcommittee specifically assigned to
review AI courses and to identify the AI literacy categories within them.
The subcommittee is composed of faculty from across campus, with AI
and curriculum development experience and assigned by the AI [2 ] Center
Director with assistance from the colleges. The AI [2 ] Center also uses in­
formation on the AI courses evaluated to assess the prevalence of
different AI literacy topics in the curriculum (Ng et al., 2021). Guidelines
on course literacy identification were developed by the subcommittee
and continue to be adapted with oversight by the AI [2 ] Center. The AI [2 ]



Center supports new AI content development in courses through seed
grants. Additionally, the course development seed grants can fund
pairing faculty (i.e., novice with AI mentor/expert) to team teach and
develop materials for innovative courses. Seed funds to create new
courses and course content ensures that AI courses are widely available
across the university and that all AI literacy areas are represented across
campus.


_4.3.2. Academic programs and pathways_
The QEP academic programs and pathways (e.g., certificates, minors,
majors, tracks) initiative includes programs from across the university
on a variety of topics and at a variety of knowledge levels – from novice
to expert. The academic programs and pathways are catalogued for
students to find easily and are advertised and managed though the AI [2 ]

[Center, taking advantage of the established www.ai.ufl.edu website.](http://www.ai.ufl.edu)
UF’s certificates, minors, and majors exist within the university’s
sixteen colleges. However, UF introduced for the first time a certificate
that spans the entire university. The AI Fundamentals and Applications
Certificate is available to any UF undergraduate regardless of their
major. This certificate was established to provide rapid access for
thousands of students across the university to an official certificate
registered on their transcript. The certificate has two required courses 1)
EEL 3872: Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (taught in the College
of Engineering) and 2) PHI 3681: Ethics, Data, and Technology (taught
in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences). For the third course, stu­
dents select from a suite of courses offered by various colleges – so it can
be more relevant to their discipline of interest e.g., BME 4760
Biomedical Data Science (EG-BME major) or in Business: QMB 3302
Foundations of Business Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. This
university-wide certificate allows colleges and departments to offer
formal AI training to their students after the development of a single AI
application course, thus reducing the barrier to entry for all colleges.
This ‘AI Fundamentals and Applications’ Certificate is therefore inten­
ded for undergraduates of all majors (both technical and non-technical)
to learn the fundamentals of AI, its applications to real-world problems
in various disciplines, and ethical and professional responsibilities of
these technologies. This provides for acquisition of AI skills, but still
allows individualization of coursework for students, based on interests
and background. In addition to these very broad, introductory certificate
programs, UF also has a suite of specialized AI-related certificates, and

more are being added each semester as more AI expertise is built across
campus. For example: ‘GeoAI: Geographic Artificial Intelligence and Big
Data’ is a newly developed (2022) certificate program offered in the
Geography Department. GeoAI provides novel approaches for address­
ing a variety of geospatial challenges in the real world (Hu et al., 2019;
Janowicz et al., 2020). This certificate develops transferable skills in
GeoAI to address issues impacting our environment and societies. GeoAI
training is critical given the projected growth of approximately 16% in
this industry by 2050 (Janowicz et al., 2020), and so establishing these
focused areas of expertise and training at UF is timely.


_4.3.3. AI undergraduate scholars and AI undergraduate medallion_
_programs_
Another QEP Initiative is the AI Undergraduate Scholars and AI
Undergraduate Medallion Programs. The AI Undergraduate Scholars
program is based on existing programs offered through the UF Center for
Undergraduate Research, including research opportunities directly be­
tween undergraduates and AI faculty programs. AI Undergraduate
Scholars apply to work on AI related research topics with faculty and are
awarded on a semester or annual basis. For the AI Medallion Programs,
undergraduate AI Scholars complete a series of courses, experiences, and
other AI-related activities as designated by the AI [2 ] Center. Students
meeting the minimum requirements receive an AI Medallion to recog­
nize them at graduation. Additional activities and courses include
experiential learning in the form of internships, co-ops, study abroad,
community service, research, public service, or design competitions for
credit hours. The medallion and scholars programs are modeled on
existing, successful programs at UF, but are adapted to feature AI
scholarship. Mentors for the AI Undergraduate Scholars program are
affiliate faculty of the AI [2 ] Center. AI Scholars are showcased during
conferences and other professional events held by the AI [2 ] Center.
This initiative includes the development of **C** ourse-based **U** nder­
graduate **R** esearch **E** xperience (CURE) classes ~~w~~ ithin the ex ~~i~~ sting
framework already e ~~s~~ tablished by the UF Center for Undergraduate
Research. CURE are research-focused courses that can feature AI as a
core component. In addition, the initiative includes team-based courses
focused on an industry-presented challenge within AI, and with the in­
dustry serving as a partner/client, that we refer to as ‘I-CURE’ courses.
Teams are composed of students from different disciplines assembled to
solve a particular AI industry question and are led by a faculty member.
Industry partners have provided feedback regarding their interest in
these I-CURE opportunities which are developed in concert with the
Career Connections Center (C3) at UF.
All activities mentioned are managed through the AI [2 ] Center.


_4.3.3.1. I-CURE courses with industry partners._ One approach to address
this gap or need within our educational curriculum is to engage in
CURE-based AI-focused courses. We propose to use the CURE courses as
a pedagogical tool to link AI techniques and approaches to problems to
solve real-world questions posed by our industry partners (I) in a truly
innovative manner. I-CUREs involve whole classes of students in
addressing a research question or problem that is of interest to stake­
holders outside the classroom. Here, our industry partners will propose
real-world problems to our class, which is led by faculty, and will then
work on AI-based solutions, with an interdisciplinary team. During an ICURE, students will engage in scientific practices, such as collecting and
analyzing data and developing and critiquing arguments, learning AIbased approaches and potential solutions, and communicating with
each other and industry partners in frequent meetings – just as in a work
environment. Course-based undergraduate research experiences
(CUREs) are being championed as scalable ways of involving un­
dergraduates in science research, and here we integrate with a specific
focus on AI-based approaches and solutions to develop our I-CURE’s.
Studies of CUREs have shown that participating students achieve many
of the same outcomes as students who complete research internships



(Corwin et al., 2017). I-CURE has added potential given the link with
industry partners and faculty leader and interactions with the AI [2 ] Center
and Career Connections Center. Student and faculty experiences, linked
directly to engagement with our industry partners, while learning
essential real-world, transferable skills, will benefit our students
immensely, and will be open to ALL undergraduate students regardless
of background. This is truly an innovative and timely _AI Across the_
_Curriculum_ approach to learning.
Our objectives are 1) Design innovative AI courses to foster team­
work from different disciplines to solve a complex problem or challenge
posed by an industry partner; 2) Increase students’ ability to work in
interdisciplinary environments to solve a problem and thus to be better
prepared for workforce needs, and 3) Foster connections between stu­
dent learning and AI employer needs with a direct linkage to the Career
Connection Center. Expected outcomes of these objectives include 1)
New course pedagogy to facilitate student learning on complex topics in
AI; 2) Students entering the workforce with greater ability to exploit the
synergy and productivity of diverse team environments and 3) Devel­
opment of processes to better link student learning with industry/
employer skill and knowledge needs in the fast-paced technology and AI
landscape.


_4.3.4. AI career development and industry engagement_
The Career Connection Center (C3) will prioritize equipping students
with the knowledge and connections needed for the AI ready workforce.
C3 will advance the university’s AI initiative to create pathways for
career development for students by 1) Educating students and campus
about AI use in recruiting practices and changing workforce needs; and
specifically, aiding students to articulate the AI competencies (skills,
abilities, and personal attributes) they have developed. 2) Facilitating
opportunities for AI to be applied in internships and experiential
learning. Thus, C3 will expose students to career pathways available in
AI through internships and other experiential learning experiences
related to AI. C3 will work to provide experiential learning opportunities
for students by working with faculty to showcase AI in the curriculum to
address the need for an AI-ready workforce. 3) The C3 will partner
across campus to launch the Comprehensive Learning Record (CLR) to
highlight AI-related workforce skills of undergraduate students. By
putting the discussion of workplace skills and real-world competencies
upfront in the _AI Across the Curriculum_ discussion, UF will provide an
innovative approach to education that acknowledges the real-world
needs for skills and literacies in AI across the undergraduate student
body (Buckingham Shum & Deakin Crick, 2016; Cantú-Ortiz et al., 2020;
Ng et al., 2021; St Louis et al., 2021). Thus, rather than skills and
competencies being an afterthought in the curriculum, it is front and
center in the curriculum and program development at UF (Ahmad,
2019). C3 also connects over 2000 companies to our efforts with AI
curriculum and workforce development.
The pedagogy we propose through the AI literacies and the QEP
initiatives removes barriers often present at universities due to a silo
structure and provides a more direct link between student learning and
professional employment experiences. This pedagogical approach uses
AI as the vehicle to create this cross-cutting and inclusive learning
environment.


**5. Discussion & conclusion**


The basic question addressed here is “What will UF’s _AI Across the_
_Curriculum_ Program” create? The goal in developing a highly innovative
approach to a campus-wide _AI Across the Curriculum_ program is to pro­
vide an opportunity for every undergraduate student to engage and
learn about AI, both within their discipline and more importantly, in an
interdisciplinary manner often more reflective of the real-world, work­
place environment. In line with this goal, there is engagement across all
colleges, as highlighted by the 106 AI faculty hires located within all 16

enhanced workforce development and career readiness of our students.
Through innovative partnerships, such as the I-CURE courses, increased
internship opportunities and a dedicated faculty and staff to support
institutional engagement, we anticipate increased relationships with
alumni and industry partners. The central goal of this initiative is to
embrace the need for students to develop real-world marketable AI
skillsets. This includes AI skills and knowledge, awareness of the im­
plications of AI in society and an improved engagement with and
communication about AI. These all seek to help develop “ _Successful_
_digital citizens”_ and “ _global collaborators”_ as well as foster more engaged
faculty, students, and staff (Zimmerman, 2018). The intellectual output
of this program will provide an innovative pedagogy for others to model,
with the structure being adaptable to different campus-wide initiatives,
not just AI.
The AI Across the Curriculum model will be evaluated using student
learning outcomes (SLOs) directly tied to the AI literacies and goals
related to the model initiatives. The SLO evaluation process will be in­
tegrated into course assessments using rubrics that indicates mastery or
non-mastery for the relevant SLOs. SLOs include 1) identify, describe,
and/or explain the components, requirement and/or characteristics of
AI; 2) recognize, identify, describe, define, and/or explain applications
of AI in multiple domains; 3) select and/or utilize AI tools and tech­
niques appropriate to a specific context and application; 4) develop,
apply, and/or evaluate contextually appropriate ethical frameworks to
use within AI; 5) assess the context-specific value or quality of AI tools
and applications; and 6) conceptualize and/or develop tools, hardware,
data, and/or algorithms utilized in AI solutions. The assessments will be
collected and evaluated each semester to identify successes and oppor­
tunities for improvement. Likewise, six initiative-based goals will be
assessed using specific metrics. Goals will be assessed annually. As an
example, one goal is “AI courses will be developed to ensure that courses
from all four AI literacy topics are accessible to all undergraduate stu­
dents in each college.” The metrics to assess this goal are 1) number of
curricular offerings within each AI area by college and 2) undergraduate
student enrollment in AI courses in each area by college. As data are
collected and evaluated, we anticipate modifications will be needed to
SLO rubrics and goal metrics and perhaps the SLOs and goals them­
selves. We will remain flexible and nimble with the assessment process
to best meet QEP requirements and AI Across the Curriculum adaptive
needs. Given the complexity of gathering data across 16 colleges in a
large institution, we anticipate there will be some data management
hurdles that will need to be resolved within the UF data collection sys­
tems as the evaluation process initiates. To this point, the AI Across the
Curriculum team continually meets with university managers to update
the mechanisms for data collection such that they best align with the
most current university capabilities. Given this curriculum model has
been developed through cross-college collaborations with care toward
specific college needs and low burden for engagement, we are optimistic
of its potential for success. However, data to support the full breadth of
the model and its initiatives will not be available for several years given
the 4-year cycle of the undergraduate programs. Some data have been
collected (with less detail) to track instructor or college identified AI
courses, with 2022 UF campuswide numbers indicating over 6000 stu­
dents enrolled in over 200 AI courses which provides a draft baseline.
The AI curriculum model presented herein is preparing our future
workforce with critical, real-world skills and AI technological expertise.
AI literacy is critical for our students in the 21st century (Buckingham
Shum & Deakin Crick, 2016; Cantú-Ortiz et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2021; St
Louis et al., 2021) as clearly highlighted, but it is key for everyone – not
just within technology and related STEM fields. This model is innovative
in its ‘ _AI Across the Curriculum’_ design, engaging with the different ap­
proaches and styles of learning developed, and transformative within
higher education in its transdisciplinary approach and accessibility
across all colleges and majors across campus.
