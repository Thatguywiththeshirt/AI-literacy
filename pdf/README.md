# AI Literacy Source PDFs

This folder contains the original AI literacy source documents used for reference, citation, and verification.

## Contents

Includes (but is not limited to):

- Frameworks and position papers on AI literacy in education.
- Institutional models for “AI Across the Curriculum”.
- Student- and community-facing AI guides.
- Teaching commons pieces on integrating AI into assignments.
- Infographics and reports (e.g., global workforce / jobs outlook).

## Usage Guidelines

- Treat files here as **reference originals**:
  - Verify facts, numbers, and quotations against these PDFs.
  - Consult tables, figures, and diagrams when designing slides or handouts.
- Do not copy long passages directly into teaching materials; instead:
  - Summarize in your own words.
  - Quote briefly with attribution and citation.

## Updating This Folder

- When you add a new PDF:
  - Use a clear, descriptive filename (e.g., `Author-Year-ShortTitle.pdf` or an existing canonical title).
  - If you convert it to Markdown, mirror the filename in `/md` (e.g., `Name.pdf` → `Name.md`).
- Keep non-PDF visual assets (e.g., `.jpg` infographics) here as well if they originate from the same source sets.
